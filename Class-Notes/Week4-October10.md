### Data Manipulation
#### October 10

For providing feedback:
Either markdown doc, or feedback issue w/ person as collaborator or new file
You should invite someone to your repository: do this by going to your repository > R script > settings > collaborators & teams> add name

- Info about assessment: on read.me file of challenge

- Script works fine but ideally on mac, on line 23 there is a 'select' function that doesn't work on Windows (answer to that in issues)

- Good thing to do: Readme file on a repository that gives hyperlinks to repo structure and different folders, kind of like a content table
- NB: Reminder to properly write commits in a straightforward/clear way

- Check issue folder to add code snippet for challenge 1
- Add license in challenge folder
- CHECK MARKING CRITERIA
