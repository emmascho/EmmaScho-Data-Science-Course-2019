# Course_Repository_Challenge_2019
Create your own repository for the Data Science in Ecology and Environmental Science Course

## Course Repository Challenge Instructions - GitHub and version control

Challenge start time: 12 noon Thurs 26th Sept 2019
Challenge end time: 12 noon Fri 29th Nov 2019

## Challenge description

Once you've accepted this challenge, a repository gets automatically generated for you - this will be your own private repository for the duration of the course. The challenge this week is to fully organise this repository and make sure it is all set up for you to begin working in it. Since this is your repository, it is up to you to decide how it looks. We have included some guidelines below and the required files and folders, but beyond that, this is an opportunity for you to think about your workflow and how you will organise your coding!

The challenge is based on the Coding Club Intro to GitHub and version control tutorial and the readings for week 1. https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html You can find the readings in the course outline in the DataScienceHub2019 repository.

What to include:

- Course readings - Up to you to decide how you'll organise those.
- Folders of each of the Data Science challenges
- Folders for each of the Coding Club tutorials
- A folder for the new tutorial (final assignment) you will make
- A master README.md file - Remember that you can't create empty folders and in addition to the README.md file for the whole repository, you might want to have README.md files for some of your subfolders as well to explain what the folder content will be.
- A repo etiquette file - Up to you to decide how that will be organised - will it be a separate file, inside the README.md file?
- A licence file - You need to provide a licence for your repository as a whole, as well as for any datasets you use.
- A data reference list - You might create a data catalogue that you update as you go with the sources, citations and the copyright of all the datasets you use. This might be a separate file, or you can incorporate it in the main licence file, up to you to think about what is best.

What to include (suggestions to get you thinking more creatively):

- A folder for generic functions or any code you develop that you use throughout the course
- A folder for side projects/dissertation/other assignments
- Personal notes
- Figures folder
- Images folder for any photos/diagrams you might embed in Markdown files
- Working folder
- Practice scripts
- A doc folder
- An accidental art folder
- Workflow diagrams

Happy coding and version-controlling!
