# Coding Class Notes: Week 9 - 14-11-19

### General info:
Go to the coding club tutorials and to class bc v. important for challenge 4

Coding club tutorial "efficient data synthesis" useful for challenge 4 
Next week will be w/ Java but with a starter script, more focus on the thinking: will be an in-class challenge in group on Java.
Can Google, can communicate among groups etc

Tutorial challenge & Repo challenge due on the 29th November but will be an attempt to move later
This will be sumbitted as a PDF through Turnitin 

Make a nice front-end telling what to look at, wiht nice readme mark down (comments and links to outputs of coding club tutorial)
Make it reflect your participation on your course.
Make an issue tab on tutorial type so don't have the same ones. SHould be completable in 2hours, can test by asking someone (?). 


**Last Tutorial is worth 40%!!**

Last week is a trip to Bayes, meeting with head of space agency thingy -> recruiting data scientists (sign up will be sent)



### Challenge 3: Feedback

Could have started with the report early on without most of the data. Put the research question separately. 
Figure labels! Need to put authorisation of source for photo (eg. copyright from NatGeo), credit + permission.

Include sample size in the methods section

pop~year+duration+(year|id) -> means that year is a fixed effect and id is random, so id will vary potentially w/ year (?)
NB: Shorter time series allow for more perceived population change, detects change instead of smoothing trend line

Having year as random effect: 
sometimes with also populations spanning continents you shouldn't focus on year as a source of variation either. Doesn't allow each population to have their own account for variation.

**When you put & focus on specific random effects, you're removing variaiton from other variables (which may have been important for testing) !**

Can run a two stage model: run some statistical models at lower level of hierarchy, 
run 2nd model with implementig effect size. Useful when data structure is really complex (not the most parcimonious) 

Justfy which variable was chosen. What the ideal model would've included and what you used in the end. Always include both models in the text but for example in the report and the rest in the appendix.  

Pre-registration was important in getting thinking before the modelling. Helps to prevent p-hacking if you upload it  to an online database.


NB: DOI= Digital object identifier (can also have it for datasets or repos called Zenodo?)

Check metadata to see if you have count data or different types of counts & sampling (meaning using scalepop would have been useful). 

If you want to remove scaling of effect size: effect size had to have the full range and account for it.

In order to merge two plots to compare, can just add the two codes within the same ggplot function.
But for tidy graphs just put them next to another and have the same scaling.
Look at slope and error around the slopes in general to compare.

Poisson distribution would appear exponential (unlogged data), it is non-linear. 
Logging your data and non-logging using a poisson distribution would look the same, slightly exponential. 

Can use tidystan to make a nice reproducable table


----

Google Earth Engine 

This is some form of GIS since it is looking at geogrpahical data! 
Big data: eg. LPI csv file, couldn't work with this in Excel -> needed R and tidyverse to work with it
For even bigger data sets -> need to use Google Earth Engine and big computers to work through this

Free for academics and 'charitable user' (costly to run this for Google lol)
Theoratically works better with Google Chrome

Tabs on left:
- Assets: chunks of data
- Docs

Works with Javascript! Have to run the entire script every time (just like Python), can't run line by line like in R.
Each script will produce a 'task' which is the output. 

In order for example to show differences in forest cover, with layers of forest gain, cover and loss, just take a screenshot of forest gain and compare to loss for example. 
Calculate cover with number of pixels for example

Language:

// are comments so equivalent to #
Structure of a line:
object.function.asking it to do smthg;


Can select different bands for the functions (layers ?)

Check Google Earth Engine script on the tutorial/ reading

Can download a table as csv and will upload it to drive, can also transfer to R.

**For next week: try to understand the tutorial, Javascript code and what it is does and transfer it to R to interpret**
